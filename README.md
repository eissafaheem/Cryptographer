# Cryptographer

•	Cryptographer enables us to transmit sensitive information across insecure networks, so that it cannot be read by anyone except the intended recipient.

•	When confidensial data is entered Cryptographer encrypts it to an unreadable format.

•	The encrypted text can only be decrypted when both the users have common Cryptographer.
